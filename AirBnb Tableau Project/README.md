Project Objective: 
A client wants to rent out AirBnb in Singapore as a side income. This project investigates which neighborhood he should buy a unit at and rent out as an AirBnb so as to maximize profit. 


Dashboard 1: Comparing demand and supply in each neighborhood

The central region has a huge number of listings, indicated large supply. However, the demand for this region is not very large. Hence, he should not buy a unit in the central region since there are already many spare Airbnbs around. 
There are much lesser Airbnbs in the north, northeast and west regions. There is also high demand in the northeast and west region. Among the top 20 neighbourhoods with the highest demand for Airbnb, three are neighborhoods in the west and five are neighborhoods in the northeast. Hence, he can consider buying a unit in the west or northeast region to rent out as Airbnb. 


Dashboard 2: Comparing price per night of stay in each neighborhood

Listings in the central, west and east regions charge higher price per night stay. Having an Airbnb in these areas allow a higher revenue per night stay. Since we would not want a unit in the central region as mentioned above, we focus only on neighbourhoods in the west and east regions.

The top 4 neighborhoods that charge the highest price per night are: Bukit Panjang, Bukit Batok, Jurong East and Clementi. They are all situated in the west. 


Dashboard 3: Compared average number of nights stayed in each neighborhood

Listings in the North-East and north regions have people staying for a longer period of time on average. These units might generate more revenue over a long period compared to units in the west or east regions that charge higher prices. However, listings in the west fall only slightly behind in terms of the average number of nights stayed by each person or family.

Looking only at the west, northeast and north regions, Western Water Catchment, Mandai, Sengkang and Woodlands are the top 4 neighborhoods that have highest average number of nights stayed. 


Dashboard 4: Overall revenue

This dashboard considers both the price per night stay and the average number of nights stayed at one time. The revenue is calculated as price * number of nights stayed. The east and northeast region have the highest average revenue.

Zooming in on the east and northeast regions, hougang and bedok generate the highest revenue.

However, we have much more listings in bedok than hougang. Hence, it is more competititive to rent out an Airbnb in Bedok. Thus, the advice would be to buy a unit in Hougang and rent it out as an Airbnb. 


However, developing a more concrete suggestion would require looking at the price of units in each neighborhood.
