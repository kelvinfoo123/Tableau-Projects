Project Objective: 
A client wants to rent out AirBnb in Singapore as a side income. This project investigates which neighborhood he should buy a unit at and rent out as an AirBnb so as to maximize profit.

The central region has a huge number of listings, indicated large supply. However, the demand for this region is not very large. Hence, he should not buy a unit in the central region since there are already many spare Airbnbs around. 
There are much lesser Airbnbs in the north, northeast and west regions. There is also high demand in the northeast and west region. Among the top 20 neighbourhoods with the highest demand for Airbnb, three are neighborhoods in the west and five are neighborhoods in the northeast. Hence, he can consider buying a unit in the west or northeast region to rent out as Airbnb.
